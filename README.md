### [2019-12-27: RetroFW 2.0 patch 001 (vfat-lower)](https://github.com/retrofw/firmware/releases/download/2.0/patch-2.0-001-vfat-lower.ipk)
This little patch rollbacks a change we made to VFAT mounting options (from "lower" to "mixed"). We're rolling it back because, in combination with a Windows copy bug, it caused FBA and NeoGeo ROMS not to be recognized by emulators when put in internal SD. Just install it from Explorer like a normal IPK.
